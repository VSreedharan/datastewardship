For the project work, entity matching engine has to be built.  I would recommend the students to implement it using TF-IDF weighting. 
Please ask the students to go through the following Stanford NLP videos.
19 - 2 - Scoring with the Jaccard Coefficient
19 - 3 - Term Frequency Weighting
19 - 4 - Inverse Document Frequency Weighting
19 - 5 - TF-IDF Weighting
19 - 6 - The Vector Space Model
19 - 7 - Calculating TF-IDF Cosine Scores

The videos are available @  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbdki_gnnYM&list=PL6397E4B26D00A269&index=81
